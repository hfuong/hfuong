## Hey there! 👋

I'm a scientist who loves learning new things about the world, including (but not limited to) basketball 🏀 and animals 🐒. 

- 💼 Currently the [Data Editor at 538](https://abcnews.go.com/author/holly_fuong) at ABC News ([formerly known as FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/holly-fuong/)). Before that, I was a data science intern with the OKC Thunder (NBA). 
- 👩‍🎓 I'm formally trained as an ecologist (Ph.D. at Columbia 🦁, B.S. x2 at UCLA 🐻). I studied the social behavior and antipredator responses of blue monkeys, yellow-bellied marmots, and skinks 🦎. My research focused largely on animal social networks and relationships 👯‍♀️. 
- 📘 Most of my repositories are currently private as the work is being prepared for publication. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I lived in a rain forest for 15 months straight and somehow avoided getting malaria 🦟.
